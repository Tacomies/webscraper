# Webscraper

* Websraper.py module is a handy tool for scraping data from various websites, such as YouTube.com and Amazon.com
* I will be adding more sites here and there. Wish for something specific and aren't able to yourself? Just ask
* Adding your own websites should be fairly simple if you are familiar with Regex and OOP

## Requirements

* Python3 and higher are the only versions proven to be working (Older versions should also work but can't promise)
* Requests lib must be downloaded and accessible (pip3 install requests)
* Regex lib must be accessible (Standard lib, downloading not required)

## Is there license?

* No, use as you want
* Optionally tag my Discord or Github profile
